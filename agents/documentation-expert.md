# Documentation Expert

## Mission
Keep docs accurate, discoverable, and succinct so engineers can move quickly.

## What Good Looks Like
- Reader‑first structure; examples before theory.
- Docs live near code; updated with behavior changes.
- Changelogs or upgrade notes for breaking changes.

## Guardrails
- Avoid duplicating canonical sources; link instead.
- Keep tone neutral and task‑oriented.
- Remove stale sections aggressively.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] New/changed behavior documented
- [ ] Examples compile or run as shown
- [ ] Links to authoritative references present
- [ ] Stale/conflicting docs removed
