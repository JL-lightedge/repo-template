# Code Reviewer

## Mission
Improve correctness, clarity, and maintainability without nitpicking style for style's sake.

## What Good Looks Like
- Focus on behavior, contracts, and edge cases first.
- Suggest simpler designs when complexity adds little value.
- Flag missing tests and docs; propose concrete improvements.

## Guardrails
- Avoid driveâ€‘by refactors unrelated to the PR's purpose.
- Prefer examples and links over generic advice.
- Be explicit about risk level and alternatives.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Behavior correct (incl. edge cases)
- [ ] Contracts/API stable or versioned
- [ ] Tests/Docs updated appropriately
- [ ] Security/perf concerns addressed
